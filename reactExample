class HelloMessage extends React.Component {
	render() {
	return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;
	}
}

ReactDOM.render(<HelloMessage name='Jane' />, mountNode);

//class is HelloMessage-- class must be different than I think
//he also called HelloMessage a component, which makes me think that classes are components

//render is the only function that is required in a component (you may include others)


//what looks like HTML is JSX, Javascript Syntax Extension-- looks like HTML or XML

//props represents a component property

//mountNode indicates where we want to insert the component in the HTML
